# interactive-card-details-form
### [See it in work here](https://vbalazs23.github.io/interactive-card-details-form/)
This project is based on a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).<br> 
Link to the original challenge -> [Click Me](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-card-details-form-XpS8cKZDWw)<br>
I've integrated all the functionalities required by the brief and tried to make it look as close as possible to the design.<br>
I've also created my own client side form validations. (First tired Bootstrap's built in version but it was too much of a hussle to make it
exactly behave and look the way the brief/design described. So instead of installing Sass and wrestling with Bootstrap I decided to challenge myself 
and write my own version.)<br>

### Requirements of the project (taken from the brief)

* Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
* Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
* Any input field is empty
* The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
* View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
* See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page
